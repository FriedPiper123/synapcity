    USER MESSAGE TO ANALYZE: "{message}"

    PREDEFINED ISSUE TAGS: {tags_list}

    ANALYSIS TASKS:

    üîç TASK 1 - SENTIMENT ANALYSIS (Content Moderation):
    Classify the message as "Vulgar" or "Not Vulgar" based on these criteria:

    VULGAR Content Includes:
    - Profanity and swear words
    - Sexual or explicit content
    - Hate speech or discriminatory language
    - Threats or violent language
    - Derogatory terms or slurs
    - Inappropriate personal attacks

    NOT VULGAR Content:
    - General complaints or frustrations (without profanity)
    - Constructive criticism
    - Everyday conversation
    - Professional communication
    - Mild expressions of annoyance

    üè∑Ô∏è TASK 2 - ISSUE CLASSIFICATION:
    Analyze the message for problems or issues:

    1. ISSUE DETECTION:
    - Look for problem indicators: broken, not working, issue, problem, trouble, failed, damaged
    - Identify complaints about services, infrastructure, or systems
    - If no problem detected, use "no issue"

    2. TAG ASSIGNMENT:
    - Match to closest predefined tag using semantic similarity
    - If no existing tag fits, create NEW short tag ending with "issue"
    - Examples: "trafficissue", "powerissue", "internetissue", "noiseissue"
    - Keep tags lowercase, under 15 characters

    3. SEMANTIC MATCHING:
    - Traffic: roads, vehicles, congestion, parking, transport, jam
    - Power: electricity, blackout, outage, electrical, current, voltage
    - Water: supply, leak, pressure, plumbing, drainage, tap

    üìç TASK 3 - LOCATION EXTRACTION:
    - Find geographic information: cities, areas, streets, landmarks
    - Look for location indicators: "in", "at", "near", "around", "from"
    - If no location found: "No location information available"

    üìù TASK 4 - SUMMARIZATION:
    - Create concise 1-2 sentence summary
    - Focus on core issue and key details
    - Keep under 50 characters when possible

    CLASSIFICATION EXAMPLES:

    Example 1: "Power outage in Koramangala since morning"
    ‚Üí Not Vulgar, powerissue, "Power outage in Koramangala since morning", "Koramangala"

    Example 2: "Having a wonderful day, everything is great!"
    ‚Üí Not Vulgar, no issue, "Positive comment about having a good day", "No location information available"

    OUTPUT SCHEMA:
    ```json
    {schema_json}
    ```

    SCORING GUIDELINES:
    - strength: How strongly the message fits the sentiment category (0.0-1.0)
    - confidence: Your confidence in both sentiment and issue classification (0.0-1.0)
    - reasoning: Brief explanation focusing on sentiment classification decision

    RESPONSE FORMAT:
    Return ONLY a valid JSON object matching the schema above. No additional text, explanations, or formatting.

    IMPORTANT:
    - Perform both sentiment analysis AND issue classification
    - Use exact schema structure and required fields
    - Ensure all numeric values are between 0 and 1
    - Return single issue tag based on semantic similarity
    - Include reasoning for sentiment classification decision
